# Attention Analysis in AI Literature

This repository contains the code for the project: "The Evolution of 'Attention' in AI Research: A Meta-Analysis of Shifting Terminology"

## Overview

This project provides the quantitative analysis component for our meta-analysis of how the term "attention" is used across AI/ML research literature. The code processes and analyzes 6,508 papers from major conferences (CVPR, NeurIPS, and ICLR), classifying them according to different senses of "attention" and tracking usage patterns across research domains and time periods (2010-2024).
